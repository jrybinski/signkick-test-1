# Signkick test

### TODO

* Run form validation according to errors listed at the bottom of the page
* Check the username availability using UsernameService
* Create new user using UserService
* Show "info" message when relevant

### Nice to have

* Field by field validation
* Use of FormBuilder & Form Control
* Display a loader
* Not using `.subscribe()` method in component class
